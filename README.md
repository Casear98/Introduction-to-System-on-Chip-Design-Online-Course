# *Introduction-to-System-on-Chip-Design-Online-Course*

# *Course Aim*
*To develop Arm Cortex-M0 based SoCs, from creating high-level functional specifications to design, implementation and testing on FPGA platforms using standard hardware description and software programming languages*

# Learning Outcomes

# A- *Knowledge and understanding of*

*1- Arm Cortex-M processor architectures and Arm Cortex-M based SoCs*

*2-Design of Arm Cortex-M based SoCs in a standard hardware description language*

*3-Low-level software design for Arm Cortex-M based SoCs and high-level application development*

# B- *Intellectual*

*1- Ability to use and choose between different techniques for digital system design and capture*

*2- Ability to evaluate implementation results (e.g. speed, area, power) and correlate them with the corresponding high level design and capture*

# C-*Practical*

*1- Ability to use commercial tools to develop Arm Cortex-M based SoCs*

# Prerequisites

*1- Basics of hardware description language (Verilog or VHDL)*
*2- Basic C and assembly programming*
*3- Separate purchase of hardware and/or software tools, in order to replicate the course labs*
